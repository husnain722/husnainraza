    <h2>How we met?</h2>
    
    <p>So we met in 2020 but we were not friends at that time because both were ultra introverts <br />
    Well at that time he  was the Pakistan's Top Anime content creator with 250k Subscribers. He didn't knew about the future and he just sold out his channel. After when sold we met again because he had some ideas for new content and he was hoping to work with me as i was the only person that actually knew about little anime stuffs and youtube and yeah also tech. His brother (Raza) he tought us the true path, and we both are lucky to have him in our lifes or else we were both astray.

    <h2>Life</h2>
    <p>Let's talk about his life, <br /> Following are his best qualities:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Loyalty</li>
        <li>Honesty</li>
        <li>Trustworthiness</li>
        <li>Supportiveness</li>
        <li>Kindness</li>
        <li>Humor</li>
        <li>Open-mindedness</li>
    </ul>    
        <p>From these qualities you would have already judged him that hes a perfect human being <br /> Let's have a look to his dark side:</p>
        <ol reversed start="05">
        <li>Ultra Chutiyaa</li>
        <li>Brain in knees</li>
        <li>Absurd</li>
        <li>Stubborn</li>
        <li>layabout & sluggard</li>
